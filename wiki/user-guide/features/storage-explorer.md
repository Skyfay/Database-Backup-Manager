## Actions

### View Details

Click on a file to see:
- Full metadata
- Backup source info
- Compression/encryption status
- File checksums

### Download

1. Click **Download** button
2. File downloads to your browser
3. Decryption happens automatically (if encrypted)
4. Decompression is **not** automatic

For encrypted files, you'll see a dropdown with options:
- **Download Encrypted (.enc)**: Downloads the raw encrypted file
- **Download Decrypted**: Decrypts before download
- **wget / curl Link**: Opens the Download Link modal

To decompress locally:
```bash
# Gzip
gunzip backup.sql.gz

# Brotli
brotli -d backup.sql.br
```

### wget / curl Download Links

::: tip Server-Side Downloads
For downloading backups directly to a remote server (e.g., during Redis restore), you can generate temporary download URLs that work with wget or curl.
:::

1. Click **Download** button on any backup
2. Select **wget / curl Link** from the dropdown
3. Choose download format:
   - **Decrypted**: File will be decrypted server-side (recommended)
   - **Encrypted (.enc)**: Downloads raw encrypted file
4. Click **Generate Download Link**
5. Copy the provided wget or curl command

**Generated Commands:**
```bash
# wget
wget -O "backup.sql.gz" "https://your-server/api/storage/public-download?token=..."

# curl
curl -o "backup.sql.gz" "https://your-server/api/storage/public-download?token=..."
```

**Important:**
- Links expire after **5 minutes**
- Links are **single-use** (token consumed on first download)
- The modal shows a live countdown timer
- You can generate a new link anytime

### Restore

1. Click **Restore** button
2. Select target database source
3. Configure options (see [Restore](/user-guide/features/restore))
4. Confirm and monitor progress

### Lock/Unlock

Protect important backups from retention:

1. Click **Lock** icon
2. Backup is now protected

Locked backups:
- ✅ Cannot be deleted by retention policies
- ✅ Don't count against retention limits
- ⚠️ Can still be manually deleted

### Delete

1. Click **Delete** button
2. Confirm deletion
3. Both `.enc` and `.meta.json` are removed

::: warning Permanent Action
Deleted files cannot be recovered from DBackup. Ensure you have another copy before deleting.

## Organization

### Folder Structure

Backups are organized by job:
```
/storage-root/
├── mysql-daily/
│   ├── backup_2024-01-15.sql.gz
│   └── backup_2024-01-16.sql.gz
├── postgres-weekly/
│   └── backup_2024-01-14.sql.gz
└── mongodb-hourly/
    ├── backup_2024-01-15T00.archive.gz
    └── backup_2024-01-15T01.archive.gz
```

### Naming Convention

Backup names include timestamp:
```
{job-prefix}_{ISO-timestamp}.{extension}

Example:
backup_2024-01-15T12-00-00-123Z.sql.gz.enc
```

## Storage Statistics

View at top of explorer:
- **Total size**: All backups combined
- **File count**: Number of backup files
- **Latest backup**: Most recent timestamp
- **Oldest backup**: Earliest timestamp

## Performance

### Large File Lists

For destinations with many files:
- Pagination loads files in batches
- Filters help narrow results
- Consider cleaning up old backups

### Download Speed

Downloads are limited by:
- Storage provider bandwidth
- Your internet connection
- Decryption processing (if encrypted)

## Troubleshooting

### Files Not Showing

**Causes**:
- Empty destination
- Wrong path prefix
- Permission issues

**Solutions**:
1. Verify destination configuration
2. Check backup job ran successfully
3. Test connection on destination

### Download Fails

**Causes**:
- Network timeout
- File too large
- Browser restrictions

**Solutions**:
1. Try again
2. Check browser download settings
3. Use smaller backup chunks

### Metadata Missing

**Causes**:
- Old backup format
- File manually copied
- Incomplete upload

**Solutions**:
1. Backup still works, just no metadata
2. Can restore by selecting manually
3. Future backups will have metadata

## Best Practices

1. **Regular cleanup**: Use retention policies
2. **Lock important backups**: Before migrations, updates
3. **Verify backups**: Download and test periodically
4. **Monitor size**: Watch storage growth
5. **Organize by job**: Clear naming conventions

## Next Steps

- [Retention Policies](/user-guide/jobs/retention) - Automatic cleanup
- [Download and decrypt](/user-guide/security/recovery-kit) - Manual decryption
