## Actions

### View Details

Click on a file to see:
- Full metadata
- Backup source info
- Compression/encryption status
- File checksums

### Download

Click the **Download** button to access options:

1. **Download File**: Direct browser download.
2. **Download Encrypted (.enc)**: Download the raw encrypted file (if encrypted).
3. **Download Decrypted**: Download and transparently decrypt the file.
4. **Wget / Curl Link**: Generate a temporary, signed link for CLI tools.

#### CLI Download (Wget / Curl)

The "Wget / Curl Link" option provides a secure way to download backups directly to your servers without transferring them to your local machine first.

- **Security**: Links are signed with a temporary token.
- **Expiration**: Links expire automatically after **5 minutes**.
- **Usage**: Single-use only.

Example usage:
```bash
wget -O backup.sql.gz "https://dbackup.example.com/api/storage/public-download?token=xyz..."
# Or
curl -o backup.sql.gz "https://dbackup.example.com/api/storage/public-download?token=xyz..."
```

### Restore

1. Click **Restore** button
2. Select target database source
3. Configure options (see [Restore](/user-guide/features/restore))
4. Confirm and monitor progress

### Lock/Unlock

Protect important backups from retention:

1. Click **Lock** icon
2. Backup is now protected

Locked backups:
- ✅ Cannot be deleted by retention policies
- ✅ Don't count against retention limits
- ⚠️ Can still be manually deleted

### Delete

2. Confirm deletion
3. Both `.enc` and `.meta.json` are removed

::: warning Permanent Action

## Organization

### Folder Structure

Backups are organized by job:
```
/storage-root/
├── mysql-daily/
│   ├── backup_2024-01-15.sql.gz
│   └── backup_2024-01-16.sql.gz
├── postgres-weekly/
│   └── backup_2024-01-14.sql.gz
└── mongodb-hourly/
    ├── backup_2024-01-15T00.archive.gz
    └── backup_2024-01-15T01.archive.gz
```

### Naming Convention

Backup names include timestamp:
```
{job-prefix}_{ISO-timestamp}.{extension}

Example:
backup_2024-01-15T12-00-00-123Z.sql.gz.enc
```

## Storage Statistics

View at top of explorer:
- **Total size**: All backups combined
- **File count**: Number of backup files
- **Latest backup**: Most recent timestamp
- **Oldest backup**: Earliest timestamp

## Performance

### Large File Lists

For destinations with many files:
- Pagination loads files in batches
- Filters help narrow results
- Consider cleaning up old backups

### Download Speed

Downloads are limited by:
- Storage provider bandwidth
- Your internet connection
- Decryption processing (if encrypted)

## Troubleshooting

### Files Not Showing

**Causes**:
- Empty destination
- Wrong path prefix
- Permission issues

**Solutions**:
1. Verify destination configuration
2. Check backup job ran successfully
3. Test connection on destination

### Download Fails

**Causes**:
- Network timeout
- File too large
- Browser restrictions

**Solutions**:
1. Try again
2. Check browser download settings
3. Use smaller backup chunks

### Metadata Missing

**Causes**:
- Old backup format
- File manually copied
- Incomplete upload

**Solutions**:
1. Backup still works, just no metadata
2. Can restore by selecting manually
3. Future backups will have metadata

## Best Practices

1. **Regular cleanup**: Use retention policies
2. **Lock important backups**: Before migrations, updates
3. **Verify backups**: Download and test periodically
4. **Monitor size**: Watch storage growth
5. **Organize by job**: Clear naming conventions

- [Retention Policies](/user-guide/jobs/retention) - Automatic cleanup
- [Download and decrypt](/user-guide/security/recovery-kit) - Manual decryption
