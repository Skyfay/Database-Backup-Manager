## v0.9.7-beta - API Keys, Webhook Triggers, Adapter Picker & Brand Icons
*Released: February 20, 2026*

This release introduces API key authentication for programmatic access, webhook triggers for starting backup jobs via REST API, and a visual adapter picker for creating new sources, destinations, and notifications. The picker displays all available adapters as cards with brand icons, grouped by category with tabs for quick navigation. A comprehensive API reference documentation covers all 43 endpoints.

### ✨ New Features

#### 🎯 Visual Adapter Picker
- **Two-Step Create Flow**: Clicking "Add New" now opens a visual picker dialog first, then transitions to the configuration form with the selected type pre-filled
- **Card Grid Layout**: All available adapters are displayed as clickable cards with icons in a responsive 3–4 column grid
- **Search Bar**: Type to filter adapters by name — shown automatically when more than 6 adapters are available. When searching with tabs active, results collapse into a flat filtered grid
- **Category Tabs**: Storage destinations are organized into tabs (All, Local, Cloud Storage (S3), Cloud Drives, Network) for quick filtering
- **Flat Grid Fallback**: Database sources and notification channels (which have no groups) display as a simple flat grid without tabs
- **Read-Only Type Badge**: After selecting an adapter in the picker, the form shows the type as a non-editable badge instead of a dropdown
- **Edit Flow Unchanged**: Editing existing configurations still opens the form directly with the full type dropdown

#### 🎨 Brand Icons for Adapters
- **Iconify Integration**: Replaced `@icons-pack/react-simple-icons` with [Iconify](https://iconify.design/) for richer, multi-colored brand icons — bundled offline (no API calls) for self-hosted deployments
- **SVG Logos (Primary)**: MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite, Redis, AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, Discord — all with original multi-colored brand artwork
- **Simple Icons (Fallback)**: MSSQL, Hetzner, MinIO — monochrome icons with brand colors for brands not available in SVG Logos
- **Material Design Icons (Protocols)**: SSH (SFTP), swap-vertical (FTP), cloud-upload (WebDAV), folder-network (SMB), folder-sync (Rsync), harddisk (Local) — descriptive protocol-specific icons instead of generic shapes
- **Lucide (Fallback)**: Mail (Email), Disc (unknown adapters) — for remaining generic icons
- **Proper Brand Icons**: OneDrive and Amazon S3 now display their actual brand logos instead of generic Cloud icons
- **AdapterIcon Component**: New `<AdapterIcon>` component handles icon rendering, color mapping, and pack selection automatically
- **Icon System Docs**: New [Icon System](/developer-guide/core/icons) developer guide documenting architecture, icon packs, and how to add icons for new adapters

#### 🗂️ Grouped Destination Type Selector
- **Categorized Adapter List**: The destination type dropdown now groups storage adapters into logical categories for better discoverability
- **Four Groups**: Local, Cloud Storage (S3), Cloud Drives, and Network — each displayed as a labeled section with a heading
- **Wider Popover**: The dropdown is now wider when groups are present to accommodate category headings
- **Adapter Reordering**: Storage adapters are reordered to match their category grouping (e.g., all S3 variants together, all network protocols together)
- **Backward Compatible**: Database and notification adapters without groups continue to display as a flat list

#### 📡 MSSQL SSH File Transfer
- **Remote Server Support**: MSSQL backups now support SSH/SFTP file transfer for accessing `.bak` files on remote SQL Server hosts — no shared filesystem (Docker volume) required
- **Two Transfer Modes**: Choose between **Local** (shared volume / Docker mount) and **SSH** (SFTP download/upload) in the new **File Transfer** tab
- **Backup Flow**: SQL Server writes `.bak` to `backupPath` on the server → DBackup downloads via SFTP → processes (compress/encrypt) → uploads to storage destination
- **Restore Flow**: DBackup downloads backup from storage → uploads `.bak` to server via SFTP → SQL Server restores from `backupPath` → cleanup
- **Three Auth Methods**: Password, SSH Private Key (PEM), and SSH Agent authentication
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Remote `.bak` files are deleted after successful transfer in both backup and restore operations
- **Multi-Database Support**: Works with TAR-archived multi-database backups — individual `.bak` files are transferred per database

#### 🔒 MSSQL Connection Security
- **Encrypt Toggle**: Encryption setting (`encrypt`) now exposed in the UI Configuration tab — enable for Azure SQL or production environments
- **Trust Server Certificate**: Self-signed certificate toggle (`trustServerCertificate`) now accessible in the UI — resolves "Certificate error" when connecting to development/internal SQL Servers

#### � Database Stats in Restore Dialog
- **Existing Databases Overview**: After selecting a target source in the Restore dialog, a collapsible section "Existing Databases on Target" appears showing all user databases on that server
- **Size & Table Count**: Each database displays its total size (data + index) and number of tables/collections
- **Conflict Detection**: Databases that would be overwritten by the restore are highlighted in red with a ⚠️ warning tooltip
- **Total Summary**: Footer row shows total database count and combined size across all databases
- **Async Loading**: Stats are fetched in the background with skeleton loading states — non-blocking for the restore workflow

#### 🔌 New `getDatabasesWithStats()` Adapter Method
- **New Interface**: `DatabaseInfo` type with `name`, `sizeInBytes?`, and `tableCount?` fields added to `BaseAdapter`
- **MySQL/MariaDB**: Queries `information_schema.schemata` + `information_schema.tables` for size (data_length + index_length) and table count
- **PostgreSQL**: Uses `pg_database_size()` function + `information_schema.tables` count
- **MongoDB**: Now leverages the native `sizeOnDisk` from `listDatabases` command (previously discarded) + `listCollections()` for collection count
- **MSSQL**: Queries `sys.master_files` for file sizes + `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES` for table count
- **Graceful Fallback**: If `getDatabasesWithStats()` is not implemented, falls back to `getDatabases()` (names only)

#### 🔍 Database Explorer Page
- **Standalone Page**: New dedicated page at `/dashboard/explorer` for browsing databases on any configured source — accessible from the sidebar
- **Searchable Source Selector**: Combobox with type-ahead filtering to quickly find sources by name or adapter type
- **Server Overview Cards**: Three summary widgets showing server type + version, database count, and total storage size
- **Database Table**: Sortable table with database name, size, table/collection count, and a visual size distribution bar
- **Deep Link from Sources**: New inspect button (🔍) on each database source in the Sources table — navigates directly to the Database Explorer with the source pre-selected
- **URL Parameter Support**: Accepts `?sourceId=...` query parameter for direct linking — auto-selects and loads the specified source on page load

#### 🔢 Port Placeholders
- **MSSQL**: Default port `1433` shown as placeholder
- **Redis**: Default port `6379` shown as placeholder
- **MariaDB**: Default port `3306` shown as placeholder

#### ✅ Environment Variable Validation
- **Startup Check**: All required and optional environment variables are validated at application startup using Zod schemas
- **Clear Error Messages**: Missing `ENCRYPTION_KEY` or `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` produces a formatted error box with generation instructions and a link to the installation docs
- **Graceful Warnings**: Invalid optional variables (e.g., malformed `BETTER_AUTH_URL`) are logged as warnings without blocking startup
- **Default Values**: Optional variables like `LOG_LEVEL`, `TZ`, `PORT`, and `DATABASE_URL` have documented defaults applied automatically

#### 🔑 API Key Management
- **Programmatic Access**: Create API keys with fine-grained permissions to authenticate against the REST API using `Authorization: Bearer dbackup_xxx` headers
- **Scoped Permissions**: Each API key has individually assigned permissions — SuperAdmin privileges are never inherited, only explicitly granted permissions apply
- **Key Lifecycle**: Full CRUD management — create, view, toggle (enable/disable), rotate (regenerate), and delete API keys
- **Secure Storage**: Only the first 16 characters (`dbackup_` prefix) are stored in the database. The full key is shown exactly once upon creation and cannot be retrieved afterward
- **Expiration Dates**: Optional expiry date with Shadcn Calendar date picker — expired keys are automatically rejected during authentication
- **Audit Trail**: API key creation, rotation, toggle, and deletion are logged in the audit trail with the key name and prefix
- **One-Time Reveal Dialog**: After creation, a dedicated dialog displays the full API key with a copy button and a warning that it won't be shown again
- **Users Page Integration**: New "API Keys" tab on the Access Management page (requires `api-keys:read` or `api-keys:write` permission)

#### 🔗 Webhook Triggers (API-Based Job Execution)
- **Trigger Backups via API**: Start any backup job remotely by sending a `POST /api/jobs/:id/run` request with a valid API key
- **Execution Polling**: Poll job progress via `GET /api/executions/:id` with optional `?includeLogs=true` for real-time status updates
- **API Trigger Dialog**: New "API Trigger" button (🔗) on each backup job showing ready-to-use code examples in three tabs:
  - **cURL**: Simple one-liner for quick terminal usage
  - **Bash**: Full script with polling loop, status checks, and exit codes
  - **Ansible**: Complete playbook with `uri` module and async polling via `until` loop
- **Clipboard Copy**: Each code example has a one-click copy button
- **Queue Integration**: API-triggered jobs go through the same FIFO queue as scheduled/manual jobs — respects `maxConcurrentJobs` concurrency limit
- **Audit Logging**: API-triggered executions record `trigger: "api"` and the API key ID in the audit log

#### 🔐 Unified Authentication System
- **Dual Auth Support**: All API routes now support both session-based (browser cookie) and API key (Bearer token) authentication via a unified `getAuthContext()` function
- **Auth Context**: New `AuthContext` type carries `userId`, `permissions[]`, and `authMethod` ("session" or "apikey") — used consistently across all route handlers
- **Middleware Rate Limiting**: API key requests are subject to the existing rate limiter (100 GET/min, 20 POST/min per IP)
- **Route Migration**: All 17+ API route handlers migrated from `auth.api.getSession()` to `getAuthContext()` for consistent auth handling

#### 📋 Execution Polling Endpoint
- **New Endpoint**: `GET /api/executions/:id` returns execution status, progress percentage, current stage, timing, file size, and error details
- **Optional Logs**: Pass `?includeLogs=true` to include full execution log entries
- **Permission Check**: Requires `history:read` permission

#### 🧩 Reusable Permission Picker
- **Extracted Component**: Permission selection UI extracted from the Groups form into a standalone `<PermissionPicker>` component
- **Dual Usage**: Used in both the Group edit form (`onPermissionChange` mode) and the API Key create dialog (`react-hook-form` mode)
- **Grouped Layout**: Permissions are displayed in categorized groups (Jobs, Storage, Sources, etc.) with "Select All" / "Deselect All" per group

#### 🐳 Docker Health Check
- **Built-in HEALTHCHECK**: Dockerfile now includes a `HEALTHCHECK` directive that polls `/api/health` every 30 seconds
- **Health Endpoint**: New `GET /api/health` API route (unauthenticated) returning app status, database connectivity, uptime, memory usage, and response time
- **Docker Status Integration**: `docker ps` now shows `healthy` / `unhealthy` status, and orchestrators (Docker Compose, Kubernetes) can use it for automated restarts
- **503 on Failure**: Returns HTTP 503 with `"status": "unhealthy"` when the database is unreachable

#### ⚡ Configurable Rate Limits
- **Per-Category Limits**: Configure separate rate limits for Authentication (login attempts), API Read (GET requests), and API Write (POST/PUT/DELETE mutations) — all adjustable from the Settings page
- **Auto-Save UI**: New "Rate Limits" tab in Settings with three cards showing Max Requests and Time Window inputs per category — changes auto-save with 800ms debounce, matching the existing settings UX
- **Reset to Defaults**: One-click reset button restores all rate limits to their default values (Auth: 5/60s, API: 100/60s, Mutation: 20/60s)
- **Persistent Configuration**: Rate limit values are stored in the `SystemSetting` database table and survive server restarts
- **Edge Runtime Architecture**: Middleware fetches rate limit config from an internal API endpoint (`/api/internal/rate-limit-config`) with a 30-second TTL cache — avoids the Edge Runtime limitation where Prisma cannot be used directly
- **Immediate Enforcement**: After saving new rate limits, the middleware picks up the updated config within 30 seconds (or immediately on next cache expiry)

#### 🛑 Graceful Shutdown
- **SIGTERM/SIGINT Handling**: The application now catches shutdown signals and performs a clean shutdown sequence instead of hard-killing running processes
- **Wait for Running Backups**: On shutdown, the app waits **indefinitely** for all running backup/restore executions to complete — no arbitrary timeout that could kill a long-running backup
- **Queue Freeze**: The queue manager immediately stops picking up new jobs when a shutdown signal is received
- **Scheduler Stop**: All cron-scheduled jobs are stopped immediately to prevent new triggers during shutdown
- **Pending Job Cleanup**: Any pending (not yet started) jobs in the queue are marked as `Failed` since they won't be picked up after shutdown
- **Database Cleanup**: Prisma client is gracefully disconnected before process exit
- **Force Exit**: Sending a second signal (e.g., Ctrl+C twice) forces immediate exit for emergency situations

#### ⚙️ Configurable Rate Limits (Technical)
- **Internal API Endpoint**: New `GET /api/internal/rate-limit-config` endpoint serving current rate limit config from DB — consumed by Edge Runtime middleware via `fetch()` with 30s TTL cache
- **Edge-Safe Architecture**: Middleware never imports Prisma — fetches config via HTTP from the Node.js runtime, avoiding the `PrismaClient is not configured to run in Edge Runtime` error
- **Three Rate Limit Categories**: Authentication (login), API Read (GET/HEAD), API Write (POST/PUT/DELETE) — each with configurable `points` (max requests) and `duration` (window in seconds)

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Mouse Wheel Scrolling**: Fixed mouse wheel scrolling not working in command list dropdowns (type selector, comboboxes). The `cmdk` library was intercepting scroll events — added a manual `onWheel` handler to `CommandList` to ensure native scroll behavior
- **Conditional Form Fields**: Fixed fields appearing before their controlling dropdown is selected (e.g., SSH password shown before auth method is chosen, local backup path shown before transfer mode is selected). Applied to both MSSQL File Transfer and SQLite SSH Connection forms

## v0.9.6-beta - Rsync, Google Drive, Dropbox & OneDrive Storage Destinations & New Notification System
*Released: February 15, 2026*

This release adds Rsync as a new storage destination for efficient incremental file transfers over SSH, and Google Drive, Dropbox, and Microsoft OneDrive as cloud providers with full OAuth 2.0 authorization flow.

### ✨ New Features

#### 🔔 System Notifications
- **System-Wide Event Alerts**: New notification framework for events beyond individual backup jobs — user logins, account creation, restore results, configuration backups, and system errors
- **Settings UI**: New **Notifications** tab in Settings with global channel selection, per-event toggles, channel overrides, and test buttons
- **Event Categories**: Six configurable system events across four categories (Authentication, Restore, System) — each with independent enable/disable and channel assignment
- **Global & Per-Event Channels**: Set default notification channels globally, then optionally override channels for specific events (e.g., Discord for logins, Email for errors)
- **Notify User Directly**: For login and account creation events, optionally send a direct email to the affected user — three modes: Disabled (admin only), Admin & User, or User only
- **Unified Template System**: All notifications (per-job and system) now use the same `renderTemplate()` pipeline with adapter-agnostic payloads, ensuring consistent formatting across Discord embeds and HTML emails
- **Single Email Template**: Replaced the legacy backup-only email template with a unified `SystemNotificationEmail` React component used for all notification types
- **No Duplicate Notifications**: Backup success/failure events are intentionally excluded from system notifications (configured per-job only) to prevent double alerts
- **Fire-and-Forget**: System notifications never block the calling operation — all errors are logged but never thrown

#### 📧 Multi-Recipient Email Notifications
- **Multiple Recipients**: Email notification channels now support multiple recipients — add as many email addresses as needed per channel
- **Tag Input UI**: New chip/tag-style input field for the "To" field — type an email address and press Enter, Tab, comma, or Space to add it as a tag
- **Remove Recipients**: Click the X button on any tag to remove a recipient
- **Paste Support**: Paste comma- or semicolon-separated email lists and they are automatically split into individual tags
- **Backward Compatible**: Existing single-email configurations continue to work without changes

#### 🧹 Notification Table Cleanup
- **Removed Status Column**: The health check status column ("Pending") is no longer shown for notification adapters, as connection health monitoring is not applicable to notification channels (Discord webhooks, SMTP)

#### ☁️ Google Drive Storage Destination
- **New Cloud Adapter**: Store backups directly in Google Drive — the first cloud provider in DBackup with native OAuth 2.0 authentication
- **OAuth 2.0 Flow**: One-click authorization in the UI — redirects to Google's consent screen, automatically stores refresh token (encrypted at rest)
- **Automatic Token Refresh**: Uses refresh tokens with auto-renewal — no manual re-authorization required
- **Folder Management**: Optional target folder ID or automatic root-level storage — creates subfolder hierarchies as needed
- **Visual Folder Browser**: Browse and select target folders directly from Google Drive — navigable dialog with breadcrumbs, single-click select, double-click navigate
- **Full Lifecycle**: Upload, download, list, delete, and read operations for complete backup management including retention policies
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time upload/download progress with resumable media uploads for large backup files
- **Connection Testing**: Verifies OAuth tokens, Drive API access, and folder permissions before creating jobs

#### ☁️ Dropbox Storage Destination
- **New Cloud Adapter**: Store backups directly in Dropbox with native OAuth 2.0 authentication
- **OAuth 2.0 Flow**: One-click authorization in the UI — redirects to Dropbox's consent screen, automatically stores refresh token (encrypted at rest)
- **Automatic Token Refresh**: Dropbox SDK handles token renewal automatically — no manual re-authorization required
- **Folder Path**: Optional target folder path (e.g. `/backups`) — creates subfolder hierarchies as needed
- **Visual Folder Browser**: Browse and select target folders directly from Dropbox — navigable dialog with breadcrumbs
- **Large File Support**: Chunked session uploads for files > 150 MB (up to 350 GB per file)
- **Full Lifecycle**: Upload, download, list, delete, and read operations for complete backup management including retention policies
- **Connection Testing**: Verifies OAuth tokens, account access, and write/delete permissions before creating jobs

#### ☁️ Microsoft OneDrive Storage Destination
- **New Cloud Adapter**: Store backups directly in Microsoft OneDrive via OAuth 2.0 using the Microsoft Graph API
- **OAuth 2.0 Flow**: One-click authorization in the UI — redirects to Microsoft's consent screen, automatically stores refresh token (encrypted at rest)
- **Personal & Organizational Accounts**: Works with both personal Microsoft accounts (Outlook, Hotmail) and Microsoft 365 / Azure AD organizational accounts
- **Automatic Token Refresh**: Uses refresh tokens with auto-renewal — no manual re-authorization required
- **Folder Path**: Optional target folder path (e.g., `/DBackup`) — creates subfolder hierarchies as needed
- **Visual Folder Browser**: Browse and select target folders directly from OneDrive — navigable dialog with breadcrumbs
- **Smart Upload Strategy**: Simple PUT for files ≤ 4 MB, chunked upload sessions with 10 MB chunks for larger files
- **Full Lifecycle**: Upload, download, list, delete, and read operations for complete backup management including retention policies
- **Connection Testing**: Verifies OAuth tokens, OneDrive access, folder permissions, and write/delete operations before creating jobs

#### 📡 Rsync (SSH) Storage Destination
- **New Storage Adapter**: Store backups on any remote server using rsync over SSH — leverages rsync's delta-transfer algorithm for efficient incremental syncs
- **Three Auth Methods**: Password (via `sshpass`), SSH Private Key (PEM format), and SSH Agent authentication — matching SFTP's auth options
- **Delta Transfer**: Only changed blocks are transferred, significantly reducing bandwidth for recurring backups to the same destination
- **Compression**: Built-in transfer compression (`-z` flag) reduces network usage during upload and download
- **Custom Options**: Optional field for additional rsync flags (e.g., `--bwlimit`, `--timeout`, `--exclude`)
- **Full Lifecycle**: Upload, download, list, delete, and read operations for complete backup management including retention policies
- **Connection Testing**: Write/delete verification test ensures proper permissions before creating jobs

### 🔒 Security
- **OAuth Refresh Token Encryption**: Refresh tokens and client secrets are encrypted at rest using `ENCRYPTION_KEY` (added to `SENSITIVE_KEYS`)
- **No Token Exposure**: Access tokens are never stored — generated on-the-fly from encrypted refresh tokens
- **Scoped Access**: Uses `drive.file` scope for backup operations (only access files DBackup created) and `drive.readonly` for folder browsing (navigate existing folders to select a target)
- **No Plaintext Passwords**: Rsync passwords are never passed as command-line arguments — uses `SSHPASS` environment variable exclusively
- **Sanitized Error Messages**: All error output is sanitized to strip commands, credentials, and SSH warnings before displaying to users
- **SSH Options Hardening**: Password auth disables public key authentication to prevent SSH agent interference (`PreferredAuthentications=password`, `PubkeyAuthentication=no`)

### ⚡ Performance
- **Cached Storage Statistics**: Dashboard no longer queries cloud storage APIs (Dropbox, Google Drive, S3, etc.) on every page load — storage volume data is cached in the database and served instantly
- **New System Task "Refresh Storage Statistics"**: Periodically refreshes storage file counts and sizes from all destinations (default: every hour). Configurable in Settings → System Tasks
- **Auto-Refresh After Changes**: Storage cache is automatically updated after each successful backup, retention cleanup, and manual file deletion in the Storage Explorer
- **Parallel Adapter Queries**: Storage statistics refresh now queries all adapters in parallel instead of sequentially — significantly faster with multiple destinations
- **Eliminated Duplicate Calls**: Fixed `getStorageVolume()` being called twice per dashboard page load (once directly, once via `getDashboardStats()`)

### 📊 Storage Usage History
- **Historical Storage Charts**: Click any storage destination on the dashboard to open a detailed usage history chart — shows how storage size has changed over days, weeks, or months
- **Configurable Time Range**: Select from 7 days to 1 year to analyze storage growth trends
- **Area Chart Visualization**: Smooth area chart with gradient fill showing storage size over time
- **Storage Delta**: Displays the change in storage size compared to the start of the selected period (e.g., "+1.2 GB vs 30d ago")
- **Automatic Data Collection**: Storage snapshots are recorded at each scheduled stats refresh (default: hourly) — no additional configuration needed
- **Snapshot Retention**: Old snapshots are automatically cleaned up after 90 days to prevent database bloat

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Dashboard Layout**: Fixed Job Status chart stretching to match Storage Usage card height when many destinations are configured
- **Adapter Details Column**: Fixed missing details display for OneDrive (`folderPath`), MariaDB, and MSSQL (`user@host:port`) in the Sources and Destinations tables

## v0.9.5-beta - Dashboard Overhaul, Checksums & Visual Analytics
*Released: February 13, 2026*

This release introduces a completely redesigned dashboard with interactive charts, real-time statistics, and auto-refresh capabilities. It also adds SHA-256 checksum verification throughout the backup lifecycle for end-to-end data integrity. The dashboard now provides a comprehensive at-a-glance overview of backup health, job activity, and storage usage. Sources, Destinations, and Notifications pages now feature smart type filters for quick navigation.

### ✨ New Features

#### 🔒 SHA-256 Checksum Verification
- **Backup Pipeline Integration**: Every backup now calculates a SHA-256 checksum of the final file (after compression/encryption) and stores it in the `.meta.json` sidecar file
- **Post-Upload Verification (Local Storage)**: For local filesystem storage, the backup is re-downloaded and its checksum verified after upload. Remote storage (S3, SFTP, etc.) relies on transport-level integrity checks to avoid costly re-downloads of large files
- **Restore Verification**: Before decryption/decompression, the downloaded backup file's checksum is verified against the stored value — aborts restore if mismatch detected
- **Integrity Check System Task**: New periodic system task (`system.integrity_check`) that verifies all backups across all storage destinations. Runs weekly (Sunday 4 AM), disabled by default
- **IntegrityService**: New service that iterates all storage configs, downloads each backup, and verifies checksums — reports total files, verified, passed, failed, and skipped counts

#### 🔍 Smart Type Filters
- **Sources Page**: Faceted filter to narrow sources by database type (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, etc.)
- **Destinations Page**: Faceted filter to narrow destinations by storage type (Local, S3, SFTP, etc.)
- **Notifications Page**: Faceted filter to narrow notifications by adapter type
- **Dynamic Options**: Filter only shows types that have at least one entry — no empty options cluttering the UI
- **Auto-Hide**: Filter button is hidden entirely when all entries are the same type or only one entry exists

#### 📊 Interactive Dashboard Charts
- **Activity Chart**: New stacked bar chart showing backup and restore executions over the last 14 days, grouped by status (Completed, Failed, Running, Pending)
- **Job Status Distribution**: Donut chart visualizing the status distribution of all executions in the last 30 days, with success rate percentage displayed in the center
- **Recharts Integration**: Added Recharts via the official shadcn/ui Chart component for consistent, accessible chart rendering

#### 📈 Expanded Stats Cards
- **7 KPI Cards**: Dashboard now shows Total Jobs, Active Schedules, Backups, Total Storage, Success Rate, 24h Successful, and 24h Failed at a glance
- **Visual Indicators**: Each card includes an icon and descriptive subtitle for quick orientation

#### 🗂️ Latest Jobs Widget
- **Live Activity Feed**: New widget showing recent backup and restore executions with status badges and relative timestamps
- **Type Filter**: Dropdown filter to show All, Backup-only, or Restore-only executions
- **Source Icons**: Database type icons (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.) displayed alongside job names

#### 🔄 Auto-Refresh
- **Smart Polling**: Dashboard automatically refreshes every 3 seconds while backup or restore jobs are running
- **Auto-Stop**: Polling stops automatically when all jobs complete, with one final refresh to update the view
- **Zero Config**: No user interaction needed — refresh activates and deactivates based on job state

#### 💾 Storage Overview
- **Per-Destination Breakdown**: Storage widget lists each configured storage destination with backup count and total size
- **Live File Scanning**: Storage sizes are calculated from actual files via storage adapters (not just database records)
- **Total Summary**: Aggregated total row shown when multiple storage destinations are configured

#### 🌐 WebDAV Storage Destination
- **New Storage Adapter**: Store backups on any WebDAV-compatible server — Nextcloud, ownCloud, Synology WebDAV, Apache (mod_dav), Nginx, or any other WebDAV endpoint
- **HTTPS Support**: Encrypted file transfers over standard HTTP/HTTPS — no special ports or protocols needed
- **No CLI Dependency**: Uses the `webdav` npm package directly — no system-level tools required (unlike SMB)
- **Path Prefix**: Optional subdirectory for organized backup storage
- **Full Lifecycle**: Upload, download, list, delete, and read operations for complete backup management including retention policies
- **Connection Testing**: Write/delete verification test ensures proper permissions before creating jobs

#### 📂 SMB / Samba Storage Destination
- **New Storage Adapter**: Store backups on SMB/CIFS network shares — Windows file servers, NAS devices (Synology, QNAP, TrueNAS), and Linux Samba servers
- **Protocol Support**: Configurable SMB protocol version (SMB3, SMB2, NT1) with SMB3 as default for encryption support
- **Domain Authentication**: Supports workgroup and Active Directory domain authentication
- **Path Prefix**: Optional subdirectory on the share for organized backup storage
- **Full Lifecycle**: Upload, download, list, delete, and read operations for complete backup management including retention policies
- **Connection Testing**: Write/delete verification test ensures proper permissions before creating jobs

#### 📡 FTP / FTPS Storage Destination
- **New Storage Adapter**: Store backups on any FTP server with optional TLS encryption — shared hosting, legacy infrastructure, and classic file servers
- **Explicit FTPS Support**: Optional TLS encryption (AUTH TLS on port 21) for secure file transfers — plain FTP available but not recommended for production
- **Universal Compatibility**: Works with virtually any hosting provider without CLI dependencies — uses the `basic-ftp` npm package directly
- **Anonymous & Authenticated Access**: Supports both anonymous FTP and username/password authentication
- **Path Prefix**: Optional remote directory for organized backup storage
- **Full Lifecycle**: Upload, download, list, delete, and read operations for complete backup management including retention policies
- **Connection Testing**: Write/delete verification test ensures proper permissions before creating jobs

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Accurate Backup Sizes**: Fixed backup file size tracking to reflect the actual compressed and encrypted file size instead of the raw database dump size
- **DateDisplay Crash**: Fixed a crash when using relative date formatting by switching to `formatDistanceToNow` from date-fns

## v0.9.4-beta - Universal Download Links & Logging System
*Released: February 6, 2026*

This release extends the token-based download link feature (introduced for Redis restore) to all backup downloads in Storage Explorer. Additionally, it introduces a centralized logging and error handling system for better maintainability and debugging.

### ✨ New Features

#### 🔗 wget/curl Download Links for All Backups
The temporary download link feature is now available for all backup files:
- **Universal Access**: Click the Download button on any backup file and select "wget / curl Link"
- **Download Format Selection**: Choose between encrypted (.enc) or decrypted download for encrypted backups
- **Live Countdown Timer**: See exactly how much time remains before the link expires
- **Reusable Modal**: New `DownloadLinkModal` component can be integrated anywhere in the app
- **Ready-to-Use Commands**: Pre-formatted wget and curl commands with one-click copy

#### 🎯 Improved Download UX
- All files now show a dropdown menu on the Download button (not just encrypted files)
- Consistent download experience across all backup types
- wget/curl option always available regardless of encryption status

#### 📝 Centralized Logging System
Introduced a unified logging infrastructure to replace scattered `console.log` calls:
- **System Logger**: New `logger` utility (`src/lib/logger.ts`) with level-based logging (debug, info, warn, error)
- **Child Loggers**: Context-aware logging with `logger.child({ service: "ServiceName" })` for better traceability
- **Environment Control**: Configure log level via `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable
- **Output Formats**: Human-readable colored output in development, JSON format in production
- **Custom Error Classes**: New error hierarchy (`src/lib/errors.ts`) with specialized errors for adapters, services, encryption, etc.
- **Error Utilities**: `wrapError()`, `getErrorMessage()`, `isDBackupError()` for consistent error handling

#### 🌐 API Request & Security Logging
Added comprehensive logging in the Next.js middleware:
- **Request Logging**: All API requests are logged with method, path, duration, and anonymized IP
- **Rate Limit Events**: Warnings logged when clients exceed rate limits (for security monitoring)
- **IP Anonymization**: IPs are anonymized in logs for GDPR compliance (e.g., `192.168.x.x`)
- **Silent Paths**: High-frequency endpoints (`/api/health`, `/api/auth/get-session`) excluded to reduce noise

#### 🛡️ Type-Safe Error Handling
New custom error classes for better error categorization:
- `DBackupError` (base class)
- `AdapterError`, `ConnectionError`, `ConfigurationError`
- `ServiceError`, `NotFoundError`, `ValidationError`
- `PermissionError`, `AuthenticationError`
- `BackupError`, `RestoreError`, `EncryptionError`, `QueueError`

### 📚 Documentation
- Added comprehensive developer documentation for Download Tokens system
- Updated Storage Explorer user guide with wget/curl download section
- **New**: Added Logging System documentation in Developer Guide (System Logger, Custom Errors, Best Practices)

### 🧹 Code Cleanup
Removed legacy code that became obsolete after the v0.9.1 TAR architecture migration:
- **PostgreSQL Dialects**: Removed unused `pg_dumpall` branch from `getDumpArgs()` and simplified `getRestoreArgs()` to stub (restore uses `pg_restore` directly)
- **MySQL Dialects**: Removed unused multi-database branch (`--databases ...`) and `--all-databases` fallback from `getDumpArgs()`
- **MongoDB Dialects**: Simplified `getRestoreArgs()` to stub (restore builds args directly in `restore.ts`)
- **Roadmap**: Moved "PostgreSQL Restore Improvements" to completed (handled by TAR architecture)

### 🔧 Technical Changes
- New `src/lib/logger.ts` - Centralized logging utility
- New `src/lib/errors.ts` - Custom error class hierarchy
- New `src/lib/types/service-result.ts` - Type-safe service return type
- Migrated core services and adapters to use the new logging system
- Added lint-guard tests to detect `console.*` usage in source files

### 🍃 MongoDB Docker Compatibility
Replaced `mongosh` CLI dependency with native `mongodb` npm package for connection testing:
- **No CLI Dependency**: Connection test and database listing now use the native MongoDB driver instead of `mongosh`
- **Docker Compatible**: The `mongosh` shell is not available in Alpine-based Docker images, but the npm package works everywhere
- **Backup/Restore Unchanged**: `mongodump` and `mongorestore` (from `mongodb-tools`) are still used for actual backup operations
- **Cleaner Code**: Removed shell command parsing in favor of proper MongoDB client API calls

### 🔧 Type-Safe Adapter Configs
Exported TypeScript types from Zod schemas for better developer experience:
- **Inferred Types**: All adapter configs now have exported TypeScript types (e.g., `MySQLConfig`, `PostgresConfig`, `MongoDBConfig`)
- **100% Type-Safe**: All adapter functions (`dump()`, `restore()`, `test()`, `getDatabases()`) now use properly typed configs instead of `config: any`
- **Lint Guard Enforced**: New lint-guard test ensures `config: any` cannot be introduced in adapter files
- **Union Types**: Added `DatabaseConfig`, `StorageConfig`, `NotificationConfig`, `AnyDatabaseConfig` union types for generic handling
- **Extended Types**: Dump/restore functions use extended types with runtime fields (e.g., `MySQLDumpConfig`, `PostgresRestoreConfig`)
- **Better DX**: IDE autocomplete and compile-time error checking for adapter configurations

### 🎯 Interface Type Improvements
Further type safety improvements in the core interfaces:
- **AdapterConfigSchema**: `input` field now uses `z.ZodObject<z.ZodRawShape>` instead of `z.ZodObject<any>`
- **BackupMetadata**: Made extensible with index signature `[key: string]: unknown` for adapter-specific properties
- **BackupResult.metadata**: Changed to `Partial<BackupMetadata>` since adapters often return partial metadata
- **NotificationContext**: New typed interface for notification adapter context with fields like `success`, `duration`, `size`, `status`, `logs`, etc.
- **Documentation**: Added JSDoc comments explaining the type design decisions

## v0.9.3-beta - Redis Support, Restore UX & Smart File Extensions
*Released: February 2, 2026*

This release adds Redis as a new supported database type, introduces a guided restore wizard for Redis, and implements adapter-specific backup file extensions for better file identification.

### ✨ New Features

#### 🗄️ Redis Database Support
- **New Adapter**: Added Redis adapter for backing up Redis databases via RDB snapshots
- **Standalone & Sentinel Mode**: Support for standalone Redis servers and Sentinel high-availability setups
- **Redis 6, 7 & 8**: Full support and test coverage for all current Redis versions
- **ACL Support**: Optional username/password authentication for Redis 6+ Access Control Lists
- **TLS Support**: Secure connections via `--tls` flag
- **Database Selection**: Support for Redis database indices (0-15)

#### 🧙 Redis Restore Wizard
Since Redis cannot restore RDB files remotely, we've built a dedicated step-by-step wizard:
- **Guided Process**: 6-step wizard walks users through the manual restore process
- **Secure Download Links**: Generate temporary, single-use download URLs (5-minute expiry) for wget/curl
- **Copy-to-Clipboard**: All commands have one-click copy buttons
- **Platform-Specific**: Separate instructions for Systemd (Linux) and Docker deployments
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual step completion indicators

#### ⚠️ warning Redis Restore Limitations
- **Restore requires server access**: Redis RDB restore cannot be performed remotely. The backup file must be copied to the server's data directory and Redis must be restarted
- **Full server backup only**: RDB snapshots contain all databases (0-15), not individual databases
- **Cluster mode not yet supported**: Only standalone and Sentinel modes are available

#### 📁 Smart Backup File Extensions
Backup files now use appropriate extensions based on the database type:

| Database | Extension | Example |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| MySQL | `.sql` | `backup_2026-02-02.sql.gz.enc` |
| MariaDB | `.sql` | `backup_2026-02-02.sql.gz.enc` |
| PostgreSQL | `.sql` | `backup_2026-02-02.sql.gz.enc` |
| MSSQL | `.bak` | `backup_2026-02-02.bak.gz.enc` |
| MongoDB | `.archive` | `backup_2026-02-02.archive.gz.enc` |
| Redis | `.rdb` | `backup_2026-02-02.rdb.gz.enc` |
| SQLite | `.db` | `backup_2026-02-02.db.gz.enc` |

#### 🔗 Token-Based Public Downloads
- **Temporary Tokens**: Generate secure, single-use download links for backup files
- **No Auth Required**: Links work with wget/curl without session cookies
- **5-Minute Expiry**: Tokens automatically expire for security
- **Audit Trail**: Token generation is tied to authenticated users

#### ⚙️ User Preferences
- **New Preferences Tab**: Added a dedicated "Preferences" tab in the user profile settings
- **Auto-Redirect Setting**: Users can now disable automatic redirection to History page when starting backup/restore jobs
- **Instant Save**: Preference toggles save immediately without requiring a save button
- **Default Enabled**: Auto-redirect is enabled by default for new users

#### 🐳 Docker Deployment Enhancements
- **Docker Hub**: Images are now available on Docker Hub at [`skyfay/dbackup`](https://hub.docker.com/r/skyfay/dbackup) in addition to GitLab Registry. Docker Hub is now the default in all documentation
- **DATABASE_URL Default**: The Dockerfile now includes a sensible default (`file:/app/db/dbackup.db`), eliminating the need to configure this variable for standard deployments
- **TZ Variable**: Added timezone support via `TZ` environment variable (defaults to `UTC`)
- **TMPDIR Support**: New centralized `getTempDir()` utility respects the `TMPDIR` environment variable for custom temp directories (useful for tmpfs mounts)

#### 🔐 Authentication Improvements
- **Port Mapping Fix**: Fixed authentication issues when using Docker port mappings like `3001:3000`. The auth client now correctly uses the browser's current origin instead of a hardcoded URL
- **TRUSTED_ORIGINS**: New environment variable to allow multiple access URLs (e.g., both IP and domain). Accepts comma-separated list of additional trusted origins
- **Removed NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL**: This variable was removed as Next.js public variables are build-time only and don't work at runtime in Docker

### 📚 Documentation
- **Consolidated Installation Docs**: Docker Compose and Docker Run commands are now in a single location ([installation.md](/user-guide/installation)) with a tab switcher, eliminating duplication across pages
- **Environment Variables Audit**: Cleaned up documentation to only include actually implemented variables. Removed references to non-existent SMTP_*, LOG_*, and other placeholder variables
- **Improved Quick Start**: Streamlined the landing page and getting started guide to focus on concepts, with clear links to the installation guide for commands

#### 📅 Wiki Date Timestamps
- **Git History Fix**: VitePress build now fetches full git history on Cloudflare Pages, ensuring "Last updated" timestamps reflect actual commit dates instead of build time
- **European Date Format**: Changed date display format to DD/MM/YYYY for better international compatibility

### 🔧 Technical Changes
- Added `redis` package to Docker image for `redis-cli`

This release introduces a unified TAR-based backup format for multi-database backups across all database adapters. This brings consistency, reliability, and new features like selective restore.

### ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGE: Multi-DB Backup Format Changed

The backup format for **multi-database backups** has fundamentally changed from inline SQL/dump streams to TAR archives.

- **Affected**: Multi-DB backups created with MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB in versions prior to v0.9.1
- **Not Affected**: Single-database backups remain compatible
- **Action Required**: Old multi-DB backups cannot be restored with v0.9.1+. Keep a copy of v0.9.0 if you need to restore legacy backups, or re-create backups after upgrading

**Why this change?**
- Enables selective restore (choose specific databases)
- Enables database renaming during restore
- Consistent format across all database types
- Eliminates complex stream parsing that was error-prone

### ✨ New Features

#### 📦 Unified TAR Multi-DB Format
