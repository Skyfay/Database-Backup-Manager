# Changelog

All notable changes to DBackup are documented here.

## v0.9.4-beta - Universal Download Links & Logging System
*Released: February 6, 2026*

This release extends the token-based download link feature (introduced for Redis restore) to all backup downloads in Storage Explorer. Additionally, it introduces a centralized logging and error handling system for better maintainability and debugging.

### ✨ New Features

#### 🔗 wget/curl Download Links for All Backups
The temporary download link feature is now available for all backup files:
- **Universal Access**: Click the Download button on any backup file and select "wget / curl Link"
- **Download Format Selection**: Choose between encrypted (.enc) or decrypted download for encrypted backups
- **Live Countdown Timer**: See exactly how much time remains before the link expires
- **Reusable Modal**: New `DownloadLinkModal` component can be integrated anywhere in the app
- **Ready-to-Use Commands**: Pre-formatted wget and curl commands with one-click copy

#### 🎯 Improved Download UX
- All files now show a dropdown menu on the Download button (not just encrypted files)
- Consistent download experience across all backup types
- wget/curl option always available regardless of encryption status

#### 📝 Centralized Logging System
Introduced a unified logging infrastructure to replace scattered `console.log` calls:
- **System Logger**: New `logger` utility (`src/lib/logger.ts`) with level-based logging (debug, info, warn, error)
- **Child Loggers**: Context-aware logging with `logger.child({ service: "ServiceName" })` for better traceability
- **Environment Control**: Configure log level via `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable
- **Output Formats**: Human-readable colored output in development, JSON format in production
- **Custom Error Classes**: New error hierarchy (`src/lib/errors.ts`) with specialized errors for adapters, services, encryption, etc.
- **Error Utilities**: `wrapError()`, `getErrorMessage()`, `isDBackupError()` for consistent error handling

#### 🌐 API Request & Security Logging
Added comprehensive logging in the Next.js middleware:
- **Request Logging**: All API requests are logged with method, path, duration, and anonymized IP
- **Rate Limit Events**: Warnings logged when clients exceed rate limits (for security monitoring)
- **IP Anonymization**: IPs are anonymized in logs for GDPR compliance (e.g., `192.168.x.x`)
- **Silent Paths**: High-frequency endpoints (`/api/health`, `/api/auth/get-session`) excluded to reduce noise

#### 🛡️ Type-Safe Error Handling
New custom error classes for better error categorization:
- `DBackupError` (base class)
- `AdapterError`, `ConnectionError`, `ConfigurationError`
- `ServiceError`, `NotFoundError`, `ValidationError`
- `PermissionError`, `AuthenticationError`
- `BackupError`, `RestoreError`, `EncryptionError`, `QueueError`

### 📚 Documentation
- Added comprehensive developer documentation for Download Tokens system
- Updated Storage Explorer user guide with wget/curl download section
- **New**: Added Logging System documentation in Developer Guide (System Logger, Custom Errors, Best Practices)

### 🧹 Code Cleanup
Removed legacy code that became obsolete after the v0.9.1 TAR architecture migration:
- **PostgreSQL Dialects**: Removed unused `pg_dumpall` branch from `getDumpArgs()` and simplified `getRestoreArgs()` to stub (restore uses `pg_restore` directly)
- **MySQL Dialects**: Removed unused multi-database branch (`--databases ...`) and `--all-databases` fallback from `getDumpArgs()`
- **MongoDB Dialects**: Simplified `getRestoreArgs()` to stub (restore builds args directly in `restore.ts`)
- **Roadmap**: Moved "PostgreSQL Restore Improvements" to completed (handled by TAR architecture)

### 🔧 Technical Changes
- New `src/lib/logger.ts` - Centralized logging utility
- New `src/lib/errors.ts` - Custom error class hierarchy
- New `src/lib/types/service-result.ts` - Type-safe service return type
- Migrated core services and adapters to use the new logging system
- Added lint-guard tests to detect `console.*` usage in source files

### 🍃 MongoDB Docker Compatibility
Replaced `mongosh` CLI dependency with native `mongodb` npm package for connection testing:
- **No CLI Dependency**: Connection test and database listing now use the native MongoDB driver instead of `mongosh`
- **Docker Compatible**: The `mongosh` shell is not available in Alpine-based Docker images, but the npm package works everywhere
- **Backup/Restore Unchanged**: `mongodump` and `mongorestore` (from `mongodb-tools`) are still used for actual backup operations
- **Cleaner Code**: Removed shell command parsing in favor of proper MongoDB client API calls

### 🔧 Type-Safe Adapter Configs
Exported TypeScript types from Zod schemas for better developer experience:
- **Inferred Types**: All adapter configs now have exported TypeScript types (e.g., `MySQLConfig`, `PostgresConfig`, `MongoDBConfig`)
- **100% Type-Safe**: All adapter functions (`dump()`, `restore()`, `test()`, `getDatabases()`) now use properly typed configs instead of `config: any`
- **Lint Guard Enforced**: New lint-guard test ensures `config: any` cannot be introduced in adapter files
- **Union Types**: Added `DatabaseConfig`, `StorageConfig`, `NotificationConfig`, `AnyDatabaseConfig` union types for generic handling
- **Extended Types**: Dump/restore functions use extended types with runtime fields (e.g., `MySQLDumpConfig`, `PostgresRestoreConfig`)
- **Better DX**: IDE autocomplete and compile-time error checking for adapter configurations

### 🎯 Interface Type Improvements
Further type safety improvements in the core interfaces:
- **AdapterConfigSchema**: `input` field now uses `z.ZodObject<z.ZodRawShape>` instead of `z.ZodObject<any>`
- **BackupMetadata**: Made extensible with index signature `[key: string]: unknown` for adapter-specific properties
- **BackupResult.metadata**: Changed to `Partial<BackupMetadata>` since adapters often return partial metadata
- **NotificationContext**: New typed interface for notification adapter context with fields like `success`, `duration`, `size`, `status`, `logs`, etc.
- **Documentation**: Added JSDoc comments explaining the type design decisions

## v0.9.3-beta - Redis Support, Restore UX & Smart File Extensions
*Released: February 2, 2026*

This release adds Redis as a new supported database type, introduces a guided restore wizard for Redis, and implements adapter-specific backup file extensions for better file identification.

### ✨ New Features

#### 🗄️ Redis Database Support
- **New Adapter**: Added Redis adapter for backing up Redis databases via RDB snapshots
- **Standalone & Sentinel Mode**: Support for standalone Redis servers and Sentinel high-availability setups
- **Redis 6, 7 & 8**: Full support and test coverage for all current Redis versions
- **ACL Support**: Optional username/password authentication for Redis 6+ Access Control Lists
- **TLS Support**: Secure connections via `--tls` flag
- **Database Selection**: Support for Redis database indices (0-15)

#### 🧙 Redis Restore Wizard
Since Redis cannot restore RDB files remotely, we've built a dedicated step-by-step wizard:
- **Guided Process**: 6-step wizard walks users through the manual restore process
- **Secure Download Links**: Generate temporary, single-use download URLs (5-minute expiry) for wget/curl
- **Copy-to-Clipboard**: All commands have one-click copy buttons
- **Platform-Specific**: Separate instructions for Systemd (Linux) and Docker deployments
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual step completion indicators

#### ⚠️ warning Redis Restore Limitations
- **Restore requires server access**: Redis RDB restore cannot be performed remotely. The backup file must be copied to the server's data directory and Redis must be restarted
- **Full server backup only**: RDB snapshots contain all databases (0-15), not individual databases
- **Cluster mode not yet supported**: Only standalone and Sentinel modes are available

#### 📁 Smart Backup File Extensions
Backup files now use appropriate extensions based on the database type:

| Database | Extension | Example |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| MySQL | `.sql` | `backup_2026-02-02.sql.gz.enc` |
| MariaDB | `.sql` | `backup_2026-02-02.sql.gz.enc` |
| PostgreSQL | `.sql` | `backup_2026-02-02.sql.gz.enc` |
| MSSQL | `.bak` | `backup_2026-02-02.bak.gz.enc` |
| MongoDB | `.archive` | `backup_2026-02-02.archive.gz.enc` |
| Redis | `.rdb` | `backup_2026-02-02.rdb.gz.enc` |
| SQLite | `.db` | `backup_2026-02-02.db.gz.enc` |

#### 🔗 Token-Based Public Downloads
- **Temporary Tokens**: Generate secure, single-use download links for backup files
- **No Auth Required**: Links work with wget/curl without session cookies
- **5-Minute Expiry**: Tokens automatically expire for security
- **Audit Trail**: Token generation is tied to authenticated users

#### ⚙️ User Preferences
- **New Preferences Tab**: Added a dedicated "Preferences" tab in the user profile settings
- **Auto-Redirect Setting**: Users can now disable automatic redirection to History page when starting backup/restore jobs
- **Instant Save**: Preference toggles save immediately without requiring a save button
- **Default Enabled**: Auto-redirect is enabled by default for new users

#### 🐳 Docker Deployment Enhancements
- **Docker Hub**: Images are now available on Docker Hub at [`skyfay/dbackup`](https://hub.docker.com/r/skyfay/dbackup) in addition to GitLab Registry. Docker Hub is now the default in all documentation
- **DATABASE_URL Default**: The Dockerfile now includes a sensible default (`file:/app/db/dbackup.db`), eliminating the need to configure this variable for standard deployments
- **TZ Variable**: Added timezone support via `TZ` environment variable (defaults to `UTC`)
- **TMPDIR Support**: New centralized `getTempDir()` utility respects the `TMPDIR` environment variable for custom temp directories (useful for tmpfs mounts)

#### 🔐 Authentication Improvements
- **Port Mapping Fix**: Fixed authentication issues when using Docker port mappings like `3001:3000`. The auth client now correctly uses the browser's current origin instead of a hardcoded URL
- **TRUSTED_ORIGINS**: New environment variable to allow multiple access URLs (e.g., both IP and domain). Accepts comma-separated list of additional trusted origins
- **Removed NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL**: This variable was removed as Next.js public variables are build-time only and don't work at runtime in Docker

### 📚 Documentation
- **Consolidated Installation Docs**: Docker Compose and Docker Run commands are now in a single location ([installation.md](/user-guide/installation)) with a tab switcher, eliminating duplication across pages
- **Environment Variables Audit**: Cleaned up documentation to only include actually implemented variables. Removed references to non-existent SMTP_*, LOG_*, and other placeholder variables
- **Improved Quick Start**: Streamlined the landing page and getting started guide to focus on concepts, with clear links to the installation guide for commands

#### 📅 Wiki Date Timestamps
- **Git History Fix**: VitePress build now fetches full git history on Cloudflare Pages, ensuring "Last updated" timestamps reflect actual commit dates instead of build time
- **European Date Format**: Changed date display format to DD/MM/YYYY for better international compatibility

### 🔧 Technical Changes

This release introduces a unified TAR-based backup format for multi-database backups across all database adapters. This brings consistency, reliability, and new features like selective restore.

### ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGE: Multi-DB Backup Format Changed

The backup format for **multi-database backups** has fundamentally changed from inline SQL/dump streams to TAR archives.

- **Affected**: Multi-DB backups created with MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB in versions prior to v0.9.1
- **Not Affected**: Single-database backups remain compatible
- **Action Required**: Old multi-DB backups cannot be restored with v0.9.1+. Keep a copy of v0.9.0 if you need to restore legacy backups, or re-create backups after upgrading

**Why this change?**
- Enables selective restore (choose specific databases)
- Enables database renaming during restore
- Consistent format across all database types
- Eliminates complex stream parsing that was error-prone

### ✨ New Features

#### 📦 Unified TAR Multi-DB Format
