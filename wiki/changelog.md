## v0.9.3-beta - Docker Deployment & Auth Improvements
*Released: February 2, 2026*

This release focuses on improving the Docker deployment experience and fixing authentication issues with custom port mappings.

### ✨ New Features

#### 🐳 Docker Deployment Enhancements
- **DATABASE_URL Default**: The Dockerfile now includes a sensible default (`file:/app/db/dbackup.db`), eliminating the need to configure this variable for standard deployments
- **TZ Variable**: Added timezone support via `TZ` environment variable (defaults to `UTC`)
- **TMPDIR Support**: New centralized `getTempDir()` utility respects the `TMPDIR` environment variable for custom temp directories (useful for tmpfs mounts)

#### 🔐 Authentication Improvements
- **Port Mapping Fix**: Fixed authentication issues when using Docker port mappings like `3001:3000`. The auth client now correctly uses the browser's current origin instead of a hardcoded URL
- **TRUSTED_ORIGINS**: New environment variable to allow multiple access URLs (e.g., both IP and domain). Accepts comma-separated list of additional trusted origins
- **Removed NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL**: This variable was removed as Next.js public variables are build-time only and don't work at runtime in Docker

### 📚 Documentation
- **Consolidated Installation Docs**: Docker Compose and Docker Run commands are now in a single location ([installation.md](/user-guide/installation)) with a tab switcher, eliminating duplication across pages
- **Environment Variables Audit**: Cleaned up documentation to only include actually implemented variables. Removed references to non-existent SMTP_*, LOG_*, and other placeholder variables
- **Improved Quick Start**: Streamlined the landing page and getting started guide to focus on concepts, with clear links to the installation guide for commands

#### 📅 Wiki Date Timestamps
- **Git History Fix**: VitePress build now fetches full git history on Cloudflare Pages, ensuring "Last updated" timestamps reflect actual commit dates instead of build time
- **European Date Format**: Changed date display format to DD/MM/YYYY for better international compatibility

### 🔧 Technical Changes
- Centralized temp directory handling in `src/lib/temp-dir.ts`
- Updated all files using `os.tmpdir()` to use the new `getTempDir()` utility
- Auth client `baseURL` changed to empty string for proper origin detection

## v0.9.1-beta - Unified Multi-DB TAR Architecture
*Released: February 1, 2026*

This release introduces a unified TAR-based backup format for multi-database backups across all database adapters. This brings consistency, reliability, and new features like selective restore.

### ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGE: Multi-DB Backup Format Changed

The backup format for **multi-database backups** has fundamentally changed from inline SQL/dump streams to TAR archives.

- **Affected**: Multi-DB backups created with MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB in versions prior to v0.9.1
- **Not Affected**: Single-database backups remain compatible
- **Action Required**: Old multi-DB backups cannot be restored with v0.9.1+. Keep a copy of v0.9.0 if you need to restore legacy backups, or re-create backups after upgrading

**Why this change?**
- Enables selective restore (choose specific databases)
- Enables database renaming during restore
- Consistent format across all database types
- Eliminates complex stream parsing that was error-prone

### ✨ New Features

#### 📦 Unified TAR Multi-DB Format
- **Consistent Architecture**: All database adapters (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MSSQL) now use the same TAR archive format for multi-database backups
- **Manifest File**: Each TAR archive includes a `manifest.json` with metadata about contained databases, sizes, and formats
- **Selective Restore**: Choose which databases to restore from a multi-DB backup
- **Database Renaming**: Restore databases to different names (e.g., `production` → `staging_copy`)

#### 🐘 PostgreSQL Improvements
- **Custom Format**: Multi-DB backups now use `pg_dump -Fc` (custom format) per database instead of `pg_dumpall`
- **Parallel-Ready**: Individual database dumps enable future parallel backup support
- **Smaller Backups**: Custom format includes built-in compression

#### 🍃 MongoDB Multi-DB
- **True Multi-DB Support**: MongoDB adapter now supports backing up multiple selected databases (previously only "all or one")
- **Database Renaming**: Uses `--nsFrom/--nsTo` for restoring to different database names

### 🔧 Improvements
- **Code Reduction**: PostgreSQL restore logic reduced by 53% (592 → 279 LOC) by removing complex Transform streams
- **Shared Utilities**: New `tar-utils.ts` with 18 unit tests for TAR operations
- **Cleaner Adapters**: Removed legacy multi-DB parsing code from all adapters

### 🧪 Testing & Quality
- **Multi-DB Integration Tests**: New test suites for TAR-based multi-database backup and restore
- **MSSQL Test Setup**: Automatic `testdb` database creation for MSSQL containers via `setup-mssql-testdb.sh`
- **Azure SQL Edge Skip**: Tests gracefully skip Azure SQL Edge on ARM64 Macs (limited functionality)
- **84 Integration Tests**: Full coverage across MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and MSSQL

### 📚 Documentation
- **Developer Guide**: Updated database adapter documentation with TAR format details
- **User Guide**: Added Multi-DB restore workflow documentation
- **Naming Consistency**: Standardized "Microsoft SQL Server" / "MSSQL" naming throughout docs
