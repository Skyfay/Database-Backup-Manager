1. **Context & Status**:
   - Always consult [TODO.md](TODO.md) before starting a task to understand the project state.

2. **Language**:
   - **Answer Language**: German (Deutsch).
   - **Code/Comments**: English.
   - **Style**: Direct, solution-oriented, but provide detailed explanations for complex logic or security decisions. Avoid unnecessary filler pleasantries.

3. **File System**:
   - Use strict `kebab-case` for new files (e.g., `adapter-manager.tsx`).
   - Place new functionality in the correct folder structure (Server Actions in `src/app/actions`, UI to `src/components`).

4. **Maintenance**:
   - Regularly review inconsistencies in `.github/instructions/*.md`.
